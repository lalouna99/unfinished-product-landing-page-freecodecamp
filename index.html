      <h2>Audience Reviews</h2>
      <p>10/10 a good book to snuggle up with. Love the slice of life fantasy style and not having romance being the fore
        front. - Elijah Zamora</p>
      <p>This is a fantastic book. Ever wonder what adventures do when they are unable to adventure anymore? Baldree
        answers this question with a well-developed storyline, characters, and atmosphere. I listened to the audiobook,
        read by him, and I finished it quickly, staying up a few hours extra each night to get through it. I highly
        recommend this book to anyone who loves fantasy and wants a new style of adventure. - Joshua Furtado</p>
      <p>I've been an avid reader since I was a child in the 80's, and fantasy has always been my favored genre. I've read
        several hundred fantasy books over the decades, and Legends & Lattes is my new favorite fantasy book.

        Despite the relatively low stakes, the story is compelling, and the main character is likeable and relatable. I
        enjoy adventure and high stakes as much as the next reader, but this was a breath of fresh air, and I highly
        recommend it. - Mori Convallaria</p>
